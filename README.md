BrainMining is a new idea develop by President Ma and impress the whole world.


The idea is, Mining directly form Human Brain, when there is a resource limitation reached. In this way, no pollution or waste will dump to the environment, no need of any nature resource, but it could still presist a high production.


To prove this idea is workable, we will test it in the Minecraft world by this Bukkit Plugin. The plugin will generate a random amount of Cobblestone, Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Coal or Emerald.

To do this, all you need is:

1. Install the plugin

2. Point another player's head in game.

3. Switch to a Pickaxe.

4. Right click.


(But remember, there is no free lunch under the sky. Every times you get a set of ore, it will reduce durability five times more than normal mining.)

Tested with CraftBukkit 1.4.6 R0.3, but should work with any version of Bukkit.
