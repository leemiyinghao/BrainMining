BrainMining is a new idea develop by President Ma (Taiwan,PoC) and impress the whole world.

The idea is, Mining directly form Human Brain, when there is a resource limitation reached. In this way, no pollution or waste will dump to the environment, but it could still presist a high production.

To prove this idea is workable, we will test it in the Minecraft world by this Bukkit Plugin. The plugin will generate a random amount of Cobblestone, Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Coal or Emerald when player Right-Click on another player with any Pickaxe.
(But remember, there is no free lunch under the sky. Every times you get a set of ore, it will reduce durability five times more than normal mining.)
